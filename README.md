# Pachira

##Welcome o Pachira, a personal finance application.

I have been using Quicken for many years.  I started writing Pachira with the
intention to replace Quicken.  So far, for my personal need, I can say I have
achieved that purpose.  I have tested it by running in parallel with Quicken
for a few years.  In the meantime, I am continuously working on Pachira to add
more functionality and making it more useful.

Pachira is an application written in JavaFX.  It runs with Java 11 (or newer)
with JavaFX runtime.

##Install Java 11
There are many places to find instructions to install Java 11.  You can use

##Install JavaFX SDK
On Ubuntu 20.04, JavaFX is included in Java 11 installation.  So this step can be skipped.

JavaFX SDK can be downloaded from [Gluon](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/). Simply download
the package, unpack in any directory you like and set environment variable PATH_TO_FX to
the lib subdirectory.  For example, if you unpack the JavaFX SDK for Windows at
`C:\Program Files\Java\javafx-sdk-11.0.2\`, then set environment variable PATH_TO_FX to
`C:\Program Files\Java\javafx-sdk-11.0.2\lib`

<body>

<p>There are a few key concepts in Pachira.</p>

<ul>
<li>Database</li>
<li><a href="./Account.html">Account</a></li>
<li>Transaction</li>
<li>Category</li>
<li><a href="./Reminder.html">Reminder</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For those Quicken users, these concepts are very similar to the ones in Quicken.  All information are stored in an encrypted database.  You can have more than one databases.  A database contains a list of accounts and a list of transactions.  Each transaction belongs to one of these accounts.  Each transaction can also have an assigned category.</p>

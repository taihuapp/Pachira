<h2>Export from Quicken</h2>

<p>In Quicken, export all data (transactions, account list, category list, memorized payees) from Quicken to a QIF file.</p>

<h2>Import into Pachira</h2>

<p>In Pachira, File -> New to create a brand new data file, then File -> Import -> QIF to import the QIF file.</p>

<h2>Note about lot matching</h2>

<p>Quicken does not export lot matching information in stocks/mutual funds transactions.  If you are not using FIFO matching rule, then you need to manually select matching lot after importing.</p>

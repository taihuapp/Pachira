<p>For regularly occurred banking transactions, such as paychecks, utility bills, credit card bills, etc, it is more convenient to setup a reminder.  Selecting menu 'Edit -> Bill &amp; Income Reminders' opens up a reminder transaction dialog box.  Clicking button 'New' will open a edit reminder window, choose the desired setting, then 'Save' to save the reminder.</p>

<p>Once a reminder is saved, one can click 'Enter' button to enter the regularly schedule transaction, or 'Skip' if that's what needed. </p>
